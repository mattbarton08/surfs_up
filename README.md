# Surf's Up Analysis <br> <br>
## Overview of the analysis:<br>
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the tempertures in Oahu during June and December to determine whether a surf and ice cream shop would be viable.<br>

## Results:
-The averahe temperature in June was 74 degrees, which is perfect for enoying ice cream.
-The average temperature in December was 71 degress, which shows that an ice cream shop could be viable all year long.
-The highest temperatures were 83 degrees (December) and 85 degrees (June), which also shows that Oahu has nice temperatures all year long. <br>

## Summary:<br>
From the temperature data, we can see that Oahu is a great place to surf and eat ice cream all year long. We would expect to see pleasant temperatures in June (which we do), but we can see that Oahu also has tempertures in the 70's and 80's in December. The tempertures doesn't appear to go lower than 56 degrees.<br>
If I were to do more analysis on this data, I would perform a query to show the number of days that the temperture was below 60 degrees to see how many days people might not be at the beach. I would also do a query to see how many days in each of these months the temperture was above 80 degrees to see how many heavy traffic beach days we could expect to have.
